# MyChatApplication
Android chat application. Uses Firebase as backend. This project of free time will be updated according to "available time and interest during free time." = Silloin kun vapaa-ajalla on aikaa ja innostusta.

## Current status 30th September 2018:

Most layouts exists and navigation between them is possible. But backend is at very beginning stage.

Backend:

- Account creation possible. However, email/password change, password recovery or deleting account is not currently possible (because not implemented yet).
- Logging in with created account possible. Logging out might have some issues.

For testing purposes, it is possible to sign in with some pre-created accounts. The username(email) is:

**testuserXX@mychatapplication.com_*

where XX means number between 01-06. The password is:

**testpasswordXX**

where XX means number between 01-06 and is equivalent the number in email.

Development work will continue later...
